convert analysis tools to use new sim results format
ensure all simulation classes can update to realtime settings changes
modify simulator to allow set point type of irradiance type changes in real time
complex controller should attempt to balance out inverter set points when ramping down by choosing highest set point inverters first to ramp
fix issue with controller update rate faster than simulation update rate
add inverter dead time and ramp rates (on set point and irradiance changes)
update GUI to use new plant data types and remove conversion to nested array within SimResults class
update GUI to use separate controllers for different UI parts
implement realtime simulation and allow settings changes during sim
implement Modbus controller type
implement ability to simulate inverters going offline
implement / test simulation with different size inverters
add ability to use real irradiance values from import file
