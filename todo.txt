Clean up class tree
Make interfaces where they should be
Make every simulation object based on one standard object, which has the concept of timestamp and that logic
Create settings classes and move device specific settings out of the simulation settings class


Consider modifying simulation to allow stepping through externally
and support for multiple controller types at once


Modify controller classes to start at set point of zero?
    or come up with some way to skip the first x minutes of simulation to allow "steady state"
Add all simulation settings to GUI
Modify sun class constructors allow configuration variables to be passed in
Create step change set point
Create sine wave sun
Test ppcSim.sim.ComplexController for set point step changes with relatively constant irradiance
Implement simulation analysis
Confirm set point outputs to each inverters varies over time, ensure set points equalize over time
Implement ability to simulate inverters going offline (either just loss of comms but still producing or inverter turning completely off)
Ability to interface with actual plant controller for testing and analysis
Ability to use real irradiance values from an import file
Repackage plant data to include array of plant data snapshots, plus controller type, sun type, set point type, etc
Review access levels for simulation classes
