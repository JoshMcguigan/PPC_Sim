Clean up class tree
Make interfaces where they should be
Make every simulation object based on one standard object, which has the concept of timestamp and that logic
Create settings classes and move device specific settings out of the simulation settings class
Add a reset method to base level interface
Consolidate controller class structure, make all controllers aware of timestamp for consistency

Create new sun type with a moving cloud

update analysis for more accurate integral
Update analysis to display on GUI, create new controller for graphing / analysis tabs
possibly move graphing functionality into analysis package
do comparisons of results (in terms of %)

create way to save and load settings

Consider modifying simulation to allow stepping through externally or at a slower speed
and support for multiple controller types at once

add inverter set point resolution settings (how many digits after the decimal place)

Implement method for testing a real controller

Reconsider running multiple controllers with a single simulation instance so they all get the same irradiance

Modify controller classes to start at set point of zero?
    or come up with some way to skip the first x minutes of simulation to allow "steady state"
Confirm set point outputs to each inverters varies over time, ensure set points equalize over time
Implement ability to simulate inverters going offline (either just loss of comms but still producing or inverter turning completely off)
Ability to use real irradiance values from an import file
Review access levels for simulation classes
