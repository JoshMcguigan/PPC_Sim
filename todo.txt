fix bug where plant makes power even when all inverters commanded to zero
convert analysis tools to use new sim results format, and to be more efficient (only look at newest data)
ensure all simulation classes can update in realtime with settings changes
modify simulator to allow set point type of irradiance type changes in real time
complex controller should attempt to balance out inverter set points when ramping down by choosing highest set point inverters first to ramp
add inverter dead time and ramp rates (on set point and irradiance changes)
update GUI to use new plant data types and remove conversion to nested array within SimResults class
update GUI to use separate controllers for different UI parts
implement ability to simulate inverters going offline
implement / test simulation with different size inverters
add ability to use real irradiance values from import file
