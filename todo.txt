Modify controller classes to start at set point of zero
Modify sun class constructors allow configuration variables to be passed in
Create inverter group class which contains array of inverters
move current graphics into a class of its own
Create step change set point
Create sine wave sun
Test ppcSim.sim.ComplexController for set point step changes with relatively constant irradiance
Separate display logic from main logic, implement some analytics, possibly some interaction from GUI?
Confirm set point outputs to each inverters varies over time, ensure set points equalize over time
Implement ability to simulate inverters going offline (either just loss of comms but still producing or inverter turning completely off)
Ability to interface with actual plant controller for testing and analysis
Ability to use real irradiance values from an import file
